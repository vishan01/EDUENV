1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vishan01/EDUENV.git
   cd eduenv
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)**

   It's a good practice to work within a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Database Setup (SQLite is used by default)**

   You can use SQLite for development purposes. If you plan to use a different database, please configure it accordingly.

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Create a Superuser (Admin Account)**

   This step is essential for managing the application.

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. **Run the Development Server**

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:8000/`.
